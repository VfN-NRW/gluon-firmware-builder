-	help
-	  Choose how wget establishes SSL connection for https:// URLs.
-
-	  Busybox itself contains no SSL code. wget will spawn
-	  a helper program to talk over HTTPS.
-
-	  OpenSSL has a simple SSL client for debug purposes.
-	  If you select "openssl" helper, wget will effectively call
-	  "openssl s_client -quiet -connect IP:443 2>/dev/null"
-	  and pipe its data through it.
-	  Note inconvenient API: host resolution is done twice,
-	  and there is no guarantee openssl's idea of IPv6 address
-	  format is the same as ours.
-	  Another problem is that s_client prints debug information
-	  to stderr, and it needs to be suppressed. This means
-	  all error messages get suppressed too.
-	  openssl is also a big binary, often dynamically linked
-	  against ~15 libraries.

-
-	  ssl_helper is a tool which can be built statically
-	  from busybox sources against a small embedded SSL library.
-	  Please see networking/ssl_helper/README.
-	  It does not require double host resolution and emits
-	  error messages to stderr.
